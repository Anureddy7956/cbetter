Strings:-
Strings are used for storing text/characters.
char string[] = "Hello World!";
C does not have a String type to easily create string variables,we must use char
we must use double quotation marks " "
The format specifier "%s"
Note: To print a single character we have to use "%c" 

Another Way Of Creating Strings:-
char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
printf("%s", greetings);
Note:- While using this method we have to add the null treminating '\0' It tells
that end of the string

String Functions:-
To use string functions, we must include the <string.h> header file in our program.

String Length:
To get the length of a string, we can use the strlen() function

Concatenate Strings:
To concatenate (combine) two strings,we can use the strcat() function

Copy Strings:
To copy the value of one string to another,we can use the strcpy() function

Compare Strings:
To compare two strings,we can use the strcmp() function s
