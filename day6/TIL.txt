Arrays:-
Arrays are used to store multiple values in single variable.
 ex: int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element

To get the size of an array, you can use the sizeof operator %lu

There is a formula to find out how many elements in an array 
int length = sizeof(whole array) / sizeof(0th index[0])
