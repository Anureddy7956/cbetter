Loops 
Loops in programming are used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is
satisified. 
A loop statement allows programmers to execute a statement or group of statements 
multiple times without repetition of code.
 
 Loops types:-
1.for loop:
In this loop first Initialization is done, then condition will be checked, 
then executes the body and at last, the updation  is done.

-->Syntax
for (initialize expression; test expression; update expression)
{
    //
    // body of for loop
    //
}

2.while looop:In this loop the execution is terminated on the basis of the test condition.
If the test condition will become false then it will break from the  while loop or
else body will be executed.

-->Syntax
initialization_expression;

while (test_expression)
{
    // body of the while loop
    
    update_expression;
}

3.do while loop:This loop is similar to a while loop but the only difference lies in the do-while 
loop test condition which is tested at the end of the body. 
In the do-while loop, the loop body will executed and then it checks the test condition.

-->Syntax

initialization_expression;
do
{
    // body of do-while loop
    
    
    update_expression;

} while (test_expression);
