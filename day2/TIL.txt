Data Types:
Each variable in C has are associated with data type.
It specifies the type of data that the variable can store like integer(int),
character(char), floating(float), double(double) etc

Each data type requires different amounts of memory
for example: interger(int) requires 4 bytes where characters(char) requires 1 byte

The data types in C can be classified into three types:
1.Primitive Data Types:-These are the most basic data types that are used for
representing simple values such as integers, float, characters, etc

2.Derived Data Types:-The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in
datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types such as array, pointers, function

3.User Defined Data Types:-The user-defined data types are defined by the user himself
such as structure, union, enum.
